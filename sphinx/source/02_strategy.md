# Strategy Plan B

- **Rabbit Hole** --> used to refer to a bizarre, confusing, or nonsensical situation or environment, typically one from which it is difficult to extricate oneself.


## Focus on Airflow aspects - delegate k8s details

## Use docker-compose airflow setup in smartflow ec2

- why 
	- a simpler way

- issues
	- does not support k8s scaling - uses celery


- [ ] reorg compose directory
- [ ] explore logging in s3 with airflow

### gaass-py cODE

- [ ] Stub out DAG from Rylie's flow chart
- [ ] Scale with Celery but isolate the scaling code
